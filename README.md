Some PHP forms to easily manage esports/game tournaments without relying on third parts.
This project was written so it could run on free services like altervista; so no background services.
Just a quick and hacky project made for fun and to learn some php.

Use it if you want, but be aware is quiet a mess, but at least since is such low-tech, is quiet resistent to exploits (if your php version is update; so go update it RIGHT NOW)
